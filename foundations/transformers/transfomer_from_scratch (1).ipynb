        "\n",
        "4. The Safety Net: \"The Quality Control\"\n",
        "Residual Connections: To make sure the original meaning of the word doesn't get \"garbled\" through too many layers, we keep a copy of the input and add it back to the output (like a \"shortcut\").\n",

        "Layer Normalization: This keeps the math from getting too wild or \"exploding,\" keeping the numbers in a healthy range for the next layer.\n",
