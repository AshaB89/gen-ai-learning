# Projects

Put your AI/ML projects here. Each project should be in its own folder.

## Example Project Structure

```
my_project/
├── README.md          # What this project does
├── main.py           # Main code
├── data/             # Your data (gitignored)
└── results/          # Outputs (gitignored)
```

## Getting Started

1. Create a new folder: `mkdir my_project`
2. Add your code and data
3. Document what you're doing in README.md
