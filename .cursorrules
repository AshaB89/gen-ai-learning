# Cursor Rules for GenAI Learning Repository

## Project Structure
- Keep it simple and organized
- Each project goes in its own folder under `projects/`
- Use `experiments/` for quick tests and prototypes
- Shared utilities go in `shared/` (keep minimal)
- Notebooks go in `notebooks/` for exploration

## Code Guidelines
- Write clean, readable Python code
- Use type hints when helpful
- Add docstrings for functions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names

## AI/ML Best Practices
- Always split data into train/test sets
- Use random seeds for reproducibility
- Save models and results with timestamps
- Document your experiments
- Version your data and models

## File Organization
- Each project should have its own README
- Include requirements.txt for project-specific dependencies
- Use .gitignore to exclude data, models, and results
- Keep notebooks clean (clear outputs before committing)

## Development Workflow
1. Create a new project folder
2. Copy the project template if needed
3. Install dependencies
4. Start coding and experimenting
5. Document findings in README

## Common Commands
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` - Install dependencies
- `jupyter notebook` - Start Jupyter
- `python -m pytest` - Run tests
- `git add . && git commit -m "message"` - Commit changes
