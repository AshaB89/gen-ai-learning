# GenAI Learning

This repository is a personal learning log for Artificial Intelligence and
Machine Learning, with a growing focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Generative AI.

The goal of this repository is to build intuition through small, runnable
experiments while studying core concepts and modern AI systems. The emphasis
is on learning and exploration rather than production-ready implementations.

## Scope

Topics explored in this repository may include:

- Machine learning fundamentals
- Neural networks and optimization
- Transformers and attention mechanisms
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Generative AI systems and workflows

The structure and contents evolve over time as new concepts are learned.

## Usage

Code in this repository is intended to be:
- Readable and self-contained
- Easy to run locally
- Focused on demonstrating ideas rather than performance

Examples can be run directly using Python after setting up a virtual
environment.

## Environment

A Python virtual environment is recommended for running the examples.
Dependencies are intentionally kept minimal and may change as learning
progresses.

## Notes

This repository reflects an ongoing learning process. Some examples may be
simplified or exploratory by design.
