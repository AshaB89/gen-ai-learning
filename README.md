# GenAI Learning Repository

This repository is a personal learning and experimentation log focused on
Machine Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI.

It contains small projects, experiments, and notes created while studying
AI/ML concepts through courses, self-study, and hands-on practice.
The emphasis is on understanding fundamentals, not building production systems.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
3. Activate environment: `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows) or `source .venv/bin/activate` (Unix)
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements/base.txt`

## Project Guidelines

- Each project should be self-contained with its own README
- Use shared utilities from the `shared/` directory
- Document experiments and findings
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Include requirements.txt for each project

## Learning Path

This repository supports learning various AI/ML concepts through hands-on projects and experiments.

> Note: This repository evolves as my learning progresses.
> Code quality and structure may improve over time as concepts mature.
